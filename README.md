### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**siddhantchimankar/siddhantchimankar** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Node-Mongo and Java-SpringBoot tech stacks
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Microservices architecture
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on scalable distributed backend systems
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with dsa
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything except for AI 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: siddhantchimankar10@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He
- âš¡ Fun fact: We lock academically rigorous science journals behind pay walls while allowing misinformation to proliferate freely.
